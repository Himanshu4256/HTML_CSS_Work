     	<h2>HTML</h2>
     	<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
     	<p>HTML is the programming language used to define the structure of a website. This is how everything such as text, images, and links should appear on a web page. Technologies like CSS allow you to style a web page. HTML, on the other hand, is focused on building the blueprint for how a page should appear on a website.</p>
     	<p>HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web. Every page contains a set of HTML tags, including hyperlinks which are used for connecting to other pages. Every page that we witness on the world wide web is written using a version of HTML code</p>
     	<pre style="color: black;">
     <b>What are the disadvantages of HTML?
            Complexity– A lot of code can be complex to handle.
            Security– It is not secure by its own.
            Limitations– Alone HTML do not have many capabilities.
            Write Code– You have to write code for the simplest webpages.
            Not Centralized– Each page should be programmed separately.</b>
        </pre>

     <div id="CSS">
     	<h2>CSS</h2>
     	<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
     	<p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>
     	<p>CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.</p>
     	<pre style="color: black;">
     <b>There are three types of CSS which are given below:
            Inline CSS.
            Internal or Embedded CSS.
            External CSS.</b>

     <div id="JAVA">
     	<h2>JAVA</h2>
     	<p>Java is an object-oriented, concurrent language. It is an all-purpose language that is class-based and runs on any platform and with as few dependencies as possible. The run time code operates in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as compiled code.</p>
     	<p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore.</p>
     	<p>Java is a programming language that beats most of its competitors in ratings all over the world. This is a fast-performing, object-oriented programming language that is used by many famous companies, such as Goldman Sachs, eBay, Google, and many others.</p>
     	<pre style="color: black;">
     <b>Some of the disadvantages of Java are:
            Performance. Java programs take much longer time to run compared to C/C++.
            Memory. ...
            Cost. ...
            Low level programming. ...
            Garbage collection. ...
            No Unsigned Types Unlike C/C++, Java does not support unsigned int, unsigned char, … etc.</b>
        </pre>
     </div>
     <div id="C++">
     	<h2>C++</h2>
     	<p>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.</p>
     	<p>C++ is the hardest language for students to master, mostly because they have to think much. ... Many other popular languages provide some cool “features” allowing developers to concentrate on their actual problem, instead of worrying about language-specific quirks (agree, C++ has so many of them).</p>
     	<p>The answer is yes. Right now, C++ is the 4th most popular language in the world, according to the TIOBE index. It's used in various areas where high-performance software is needed. For example, Adobe products, Unreal Engine, and browsers like Chrome and Firefox are built with C++.</p>
     	<p>Originally Answered: if C++ is the most powerful, why isnt it the most popular? It's often not the fastest language to finish a program in and it's very easy to introduce bugs in a C++ program; really nasty bugs.</p>

     <div id="#C">
     	<h2>#C</h2>
     	<p>he C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX and is an imperative programming language. C was developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. ... C is a compiled language.</p>
     	<p>It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.</p>
     	<p>The C program is the human-readable form, while the executable that comes out of the compiler is the machine-readable and executable form. What this means is that to write and run a C program, you must have access to a C compiler.</p>
     	<p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.</p>
